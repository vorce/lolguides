                aggregated on this site? 
                </p>
                <p>
                A: Because they are the four, for now, sites with the most
                up to date and high quality, in depth guides. I'm however
                open to add new source sites if they are deemed good
                enough.<br />

                <p>Q: What does the rating mean?</p>
                <p>A: The rating is just a numerical representation of a guide's
                grade on its source site. This means you can't really compare
                guides from different source sites.
                <ul>
                <li>Solomid: Rating is calculated from the likes and dislike
                with the <a
                href="https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/reddits-comment-ranking-algorithm/">algorithm
                from reddit</a>.</li>
                <li>Clg: Rating is simply the number of likes</li>
                <li>Lolpro: Again, the rating is just the number of likes</li>
                <li>Lolking: Same as solomid.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Q: What does gray star and gold star mean?
                </p>
                <p>A: Gray star means the guide is not featured on its source
                site. Gold star means it is featured.
                </p>

                <p>Q: There are no good guides listed for my favorite champ
                X?!</p>
                <p>A: Then there probably isn't any good rated guides available
                for champion X on either solomid nor clgaming. Sorry! (There's
                also the possibility that my scraping has a bug - in that case
                feel free to contact me)

                <p>Q: Who created lolguides.net?</p>
                <p>A: <a href="http://joel.vorce.se">Me!</a></p>
                <hr />
                <p>Q: There's no section or any guides yet for the new champion
                Y!?</p>
                <p>A: Don't worry, it is probably on its way. It takes a
                while to add a new section, icon etc for me. Then it of course
                take a bit of time for
                people to actually try the champion and write up a decent guide
                for it. Hang in there.</p>

                <p>Q: Why the ads?</p>
                <p>A: No ads anymore! They didn't really generate any
                revenue, only made the site look more trashy.</p>
                <p>I put them up, before, to hopefully cover hosting costs.
                <hr />
                <p>Q: Why doesn't my guide, which is up on site Z show up on
                lolguides?</p>
                <p>A: It's rating is probably too low. No guides with sub
                zero rating will be listed on the top guides section.
                The latest guides section may list guides with a sub zero
                rating though.</p>
