            Lolguides started out as a personal little resource, to help
            me quickly access only the most reliable and up to date
            champion guides.
            </p>
            <p>
At the moment only <a
                    href="http://www.solomid.net">solomid's</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.clgaming.net">clgaming's</a> and
                <a href="http://lolpro.com">lolpro's</a> (Curse gaming) guides are included.
                Later I might add <a
                    href="http://leaguecraft.com">leaguecraft</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.mobafire.com">mobafire</a> or other places with
                quality LoL guides.
                </p>
                <p>
                The motivation for this site was simply that it was starting to
                get frustrating having to check multiple sites for guides. Now
                the best and latest are in one place! Hoorah.
                </p>

                Some technical details for the curious: The data is scraped
                by
                a python script (using <a
                    href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>) and output to 
                a nice, clean JSON dump. Another python program is responsible
                for generating all the champion pages (and the index, but not this
                about page) from the data dump. The site is rebuilt a whole
                bunch of times per day to make sure it stays up to date.
